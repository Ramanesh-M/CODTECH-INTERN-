Objective:
To measure and display temperature and humidity using a DHT sensor connected to an Arduino.

Components Required:
Arduino Board (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega)
DHT Sensor (e.g., DHT11 or DHT22)
Resistor (10k ohms for DHT11)
Breadboard
Jumper Wires
USB Cable (for connecting Arduino to the computer)
Setup and Connections:
DHT Sensor Pin Configuration:
VCC: Connect to 5V on the Arduino.
Data: Connect to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 2).
GND: Connect to the ground (GND) on the Arduino.
Pull-up Resistor: Place a 10k ohm resistor between VCC and the Data pin if using DHT11.

Explanation of the Code:
Library Inclusion and Object Creation:

#include "DHT.h" includes the DHT library.
DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE); creates a DHT object for sensor interaction.
Setup Function:

Initializes serial communication and the DHT sensor.
Loop Function:

Waits 2 seconds between readings.
Reads humidity and temperature.
Checks if readings are valid.
Prints the humidity and temperature to the Serial Monitor.
Viewing the Output:
Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
Set the baud rate to 9600.
View the humidity and temperature readings every 2 seconds.
This project provides a basic understanding of how to use a DHT sensor with an Arduino to monitor environmental conditions.
